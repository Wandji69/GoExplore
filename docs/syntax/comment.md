###  Comments
Comments are used to provide information about your code. Comments are not executed by the Golang compiler.: As you will have seen right up to now we have been heavily making use of comments. Comments are usually of two forms
- Line comments start with the character sequence `//` and stop at the end of the line. 
- General comments start with the character sequence `/*` and stop with the first subsequent character sequence `*/`.

```go   
/* 1. example of mulitple line comment
   2. comment continues here
   3. and then it ends
*/
```
